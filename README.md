Objective
===

Crate a budget application that utilizes react / redux. Use jest to unit test reducers and actions. Must be able to add a budget category, update it, delete it. 

Steps Taken
===

Started by creating reducers for category add, remove, update and test them with jest while building. Create category actions using the same method. Create a Dashboard component that will store a form to create a category. Create a CategoryForm component that can be used to add or edit a category. Create a CategoryItem component that will display a category.

Reflection / Changes

This helped me better understand how unit testing is done, and why it is done.
